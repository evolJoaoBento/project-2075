## 🌡️ **"Climate Collapse in South Asia"**

---

### 🔥 **Event Summary**

In April 2040, an unprecedented heatwave engulfs South Asia, with temperatures soaring beyond 55°C (131°F) across vast regions of India and Pakistan. This catastrophic event results in over 1.5 million fatalities, primarily among vulnerable populations lacking access to adequate cooling, clean water, and healthcare. The crisis is exacerbated by prolonged droughts, erratic monsoon patterns, and the failure of critical infrastructure.

### 🌊 **Breakdown of the Indus Waters Treaty**

The extreme heat intensifies existing water scarcity, leading to the collapse of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) between India and Pakistan. India, citing national security concerns and the need to prioritize its own water needs, unilaterally suspends the treaty, disrupting the flow of the Indus River into Pakistan. This action severely impacts Pakistan's agriculture and hydropower sectors, leading to economic turmoil and civil unrest.([downtoearth.org.in](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/treaty-in-abeyance-climate-conflict-indus-waters?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Indus Treaty Suspended: Impact on South Asia's Water Politics"), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Waters_Treaty?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Indus Waters Treaty"), [time.com](https://time.com/7284470/india-pakistan-water-supply-climate-change/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Climate Change Is Straining Pakistan's Water.

### 🧭 **Mass Migration and Internal Displacement**

The heatwave and water crisis trigger massive internal displacement:

- **India**: Approximately 40 million people from the central and southern states migrate northward, seeking refuge in cooler regions.
    
- **Pakistan**: Over 20 million individuals are displaced, with many attempting to cross into neighboring countries.
    
- **Bangladesh**: Facing rising sea levels and extreme heat, millions move towards the northeastern regions, leading to overcrowding and resource strain.
    

India responds by deploying military forces to manage internal migration, establishing controlled zones and restricting movement to prevent overburdening of resources in the northern states.

### 🌐 **Global Response: Establishment of Climate Refugee Corridors**

Recognizing the scale of the humanitarian crisis, the international community initiates the creation of the first **Climate Refugee Corridors**:

- **United Nations**: Convenes an emergency summit resulting in the "South Asia Climate Migration Accord," facilitating safe passage and resettlement for climate refugees.
    
- **Neighboring Countries**: Nepal and Bhutan open their borders to a limited number of refugees, with international aid supporting the influx.
    
- **International Aid**: Countries like Canada, Germany, and Japan pledge significant resources to support refugee camps and infrastructure development in affected regions.
