## 📅 Date
**November 18, 2060**

## 🌡️ Event Summary

Two decades after the **2040 South Asian climate catastrophe** and the **2041 Indo-Pakistani nuclear exchange**, the world reaches a grim milestone: the **Institute for Environmental Peace (IEP)** reports that over **1 billion people** globally have been displaced due to a combination of **extreme climate events**, **state collapse**, and **environmental degradation**.

This marks the largest human migration in recorded history, with cascading humanitarian, political, and economic consequences. The global system begins to reorient not around territory or economy—but around the management of population flows.

## 🔥 Origins: From South Asia to Global Collapse

- **2040–2042**: A lethal heatwave in India and Pakistan kills over 1.5 million people and destabilizes the **Indus Waters Treaty**, leading to water conflicts and mass migration.
- **2041**: A terrorist attack and retaliatory military strike culminate in **Pakistan’s limited nuclear use** in Rajasthan, compounding displacement and ecological damage.
- **2040s–2050s**: Similar breakdowns occur in Nigeria, Indonesia, Sudan, and Bangladesh as rising sea levels, desertification, and erratic monsoons displace tens of millions.

## 🧭 Migration & Resettlement Patterns

- **India & Pakistan**: Over **150 million** internally displaced persons are held in semi-militarized “Migration Containment Zones” in the north. Communal tensions and religious extremism surge.
- **Nigeria**: The north collapses into climate warlordism. Coastal Lagos becomes a megacity fortress surrounded by ungovernable zones.
- **Indonesia & Philippines**: Sea-level rise swallows lowland islands. The **Maritime Climate Resettlement Treaty (MCRT)** resettles over 20 million islanders in New Guinea, Borneo, and Australasia.

## 🛰️ Global Policy Shifts

### 🛡️ “Fortress Borders” in the Global North

- **EU** deploys **AI surveillance walls**, auto-detention drones, and predictive climate-identity screening under the **Pan-European Migration Directive**.
- **USA** implements “Water Wall Doctrine” on southern borders, combining desalinization-linked access passes with **biometric filtering**.
- **Australia and Japan** operate **Offshore Refugee Platforms** in neutral waters.

### 🌱 “Open Resettlement States”

- **Canada, New Zealand, and Chile** embrace managed climate immigration via **demographic revival frameworks**, offering land grants, birth incentives, and decentralized eco-residency contracts.
- These nations become **model states** in the UN's new “Climate Adaptation Index.”

## 🧨 Rise of Nationalist Migration Narratives

The unprecedented scale of climate migration fuels a **global surge in nationalist, isolationist, and ethno-populist ideologies**:

- **“Eco-Nationalism”** becomes a dominant rhetoric in Europe and the U.S., arguing that only national preservation can ensure climate resilience.
- Militant factions in several EU states target refugee housing zones, claiming they dilute scarce resources and cultural identity.
- **Digital disinformation campaigns**, especially from factions like the D.O.C.S. splinter cells, amplify myths of migrant-linked eco-sabotage and viral bioweapons.
- Political parties in **France, Poland, Hungary, and several U.S. states** rise to power promising "land loyalty clauses," mandating generational proof of citizenship for land and water access.

🧠 *In fiction:* Migration becomes a geopolitical and **existential identity battleground**, affecting how laws, AI systems, and even birthrights are interpreted.

---

## 🌐 Institutional Response

- **UN Office for Climate Displacement (UN-OCD)** created in 2052, elevated to “High Crisis Mandate” in 2060.
- UN General Assembly passes the **“Planetary Mobility Compact”**, redefining sovereignty to include climate-bound movement rights.
- Digital citizenship and **transborder rights-as-a-service models** begin pilot testing in Africa and Latin America.

## 🧠 Strategic Outcomes

| Dimension | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| **Population Flows** | Becomes a core organizing force of global politics, equal to state sovereignty. |
| **Sovereignty** | Reinterpreted to accommodate “ecological nationality” and cross-border continuity zones. |
| **Technology & AI** | Border management, language integration, and refugee credit allocation become AI-governed. |
| **Conflict Zones** | Climate-fueled instability merges with migration crises, e.g., Sahel, Indus Delta, Mekong. |
| **Ideology** | Global split between open-adaptation states and nationalist-fortress models. |

## 📌 Campaign/Worldbuilding Notes

- *Refugee characters* may have legal but limited digital citizenship tethered to cities in Canada or Chile.
- *Eco-commune zones* in tolerant countries (like in Russia’s east, New Zealand’s South Island, or Patagonia) are mixed with UN observers, NGO-funded clinics, and barter systems.
- *Plotlines:*  
  - Refugee caravans under drone surveillance trying to reach adaptation zones.  
  - Climate supremacist militias pushing "first-soil rights" ideology.  
  - Urban migrants seeking legal upgrade to Tier-1 status through biometrically verified carbon work.
