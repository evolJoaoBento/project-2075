## 🌍 Closing Perspective

The **2034–2037 Arctic Crisis** becomes a **turning point in the post-Western order**. While the West hesitated and fragmented, Russia moved fast, broke taboos, **and rewrote the rules of Arctic sovereignty**. The Lomonosov Ridge dispute didn’t end in compromise—it ended in conquest wrapped in diplomacy.

Russia, long seen as frozen in 20th-century ambition, reemerges as the **cold frontier hegemon** of the 21st century—**the architect of a new polar empire**.
