## 📅 Event Date  
**April 15, 2049**

## 🌍 Event Summary

After nearly a decade of demographic crisis in the South and ideological escalation from the North, the **Korean Peninsula** undergoes a historic transformation. Following a **nonviolent internal revolt in Seoul** against AI-governance and synthetic family systems, a coalition of **“Human Continuity Movements”**—backed covertly by **North Korean ideological networks**—seizes control of key ministries.

Rather than reasserting authoritarian control, both Korean governments enter into an unprecedented **ecopolitical unification accord**, brokered by **China** and **Japan**, and monitored by the **UN Biopolitical Commission**.

The new entity is dubbed the **Unified Korean Ecocommonwealth** (UKEC), with dual capitals in **Pyongyang** and **Busan**.

## ⚠️ Consequences

- 🧨 **AI Infrastructure Rollback**  
  Thousands of ParentBots and AI-governance modules are decommissioned or relocated. South Korea’s SSCCP (State-Sponsored Child Continuity Program) is dissolved.

- 🏞️ **Return-to-Earth Doctrine**  
  The new government bans synthetic reproduction, reintroduces land-based rites of passage, and declares the **“Human Lineage Restoration Decade.”**

- 🛡️ **International Oversight**  
  The **UN Peace Transition Authority (UNPTA)** is deployed to prevent military retaliation or civil war.

- 🤝 **Border Deconstruction**  
  The DMZ is transformed into a **UNESCO Bio-Reconciliation Park**, symbolizing humanity’s return to balance with nature and each other.

## 🌐 Global Impact

- 🇨🇳 **China** supports the unification as a strategic buffer against U.S. influence, gaining cultural clout in “organic governance diplomacy.”

- 🇺🇸 **U.S. firms** lose access to key South Korean tech markets, and the Pentagon expresses concern over the retreat of democratic infrastructure.

- 🇯🇵 **Japan** tightens immigration and reevaluates its own AI policies amid rising anti-synthetic sentiments.
