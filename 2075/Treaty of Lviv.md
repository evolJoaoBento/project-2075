## **"Treaty of Lviv": Eurasian Equilibrium Reached**

---

### **Event Summary**

After nearly a decade of grinding warfare, economic fragmentation, and political fatigue, a **historic Eurasian peace framework** is brokered by **China**, resulting in the **Treaty of Lviv**. Signed in the neutralized Ukrainian city under joint OSCE‚ÄìShanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) mediation, the treaty formally ends hostilities. Russia retains **sovereignty over Donetsk and Luhansk**, while **withdrawing from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia**, in exchange for **phased sanctions relief**, NATO de-escalation guarantees, and a new multilateral regional order.

## ‚öñÔ∏è ROOT CAUSES OF RESOLUTION

### **1. Strategic Exhaustion and Internal Reordering**

- The long war drains Russia‚Äôs economy, leading to **supply chain collapse**, **urban discontent**, and political turnover within the Kremlin's second echelon.
    
- In Ukraine, war fatigue and economic displacement force **pragmatists in Kyiv** to prioritize territorial consolidation and Western economic integration.
    
- The U.S. and EU shift resources to **Indo-Pacific security** and **climate resilience**, seeking stabilization on the Eurasian front.

### **2. China‚Äôs Mediator Strategy: The ‚ÄúHarmonious Stabilization Doctrine‚Äù**

- China reframes the peace initiative as a **‚Äúcivilizational stabilization arc‚Äù**, positioning itself as the post-Western world's diplomatic anchor.
    
- Beijing convenes **parallel bilateral backchannels** with Moscow, Kyiv, and Berlin, offering reconstruction incentives through **Belt and Road 2.0** frameworks.
    
- A ‚ÄúNew Continental Compact‚Äù is introduced, emphasizing **buffer zones, autonomy frameworks**, and economic corridors over military guarantees.

## üìå CLOSING REMARK

The **Treaty of Lviv** represents not the restoration of the old order, but the **birth of a managed multipolar reality** in Eastern Europe. It signals the **waning of military absolutism**, replaced by economic incentives, constrained sovereignties, and **civilizational realignment** under new power brokers. Like the **Silicon Accord** in East Asia, it sets a tone for **pragmatic peace rooted in exhaustion, incentives, and face-saving equilibrium**.
