# üß® Breakup of the Russian Federation Begins

## üìÖ Date  
**May 9, 2056**

## üó∫Ô∏è Summary  
The long-standing geopolitical and internal stresses in the Russian Federation reach a breaking point as the **Chechen Republic holds a successful secession referendum**, declaring independence. Simultaneously, a coalition of **Siberian cities including Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, and Krasnoyarsk** announce the formation of the **Siberian Economic Compact**, seeking full fiscal autonomy from Moscow under a post-carbon development framework.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Consequences

- **Martial Law**: The Russian central government, led by President Natalia Petrova, imposes martial law in 12 western and central oblasts, including Volgograd, Tatarstan, and Buryatia.
- **Siberian Network Shutdowns**: AI-governed infrastructure nodes in Irkutsk and Omsk are cut off from Moscow‚Äôs national grid, sparking blackouts and digital sovereignty declarations.
- **Foreign Intelligence Surge**: NATO intelligence and Chinese operatives begin active missions in the newly unstable areas to monitor nuclear arsenals, separatist movements, and critical infrastructure.
- **Kremlin Directive No. 4517** is issued, establishing the "Federal Continuity and Stabilization Council" (FCSC), later criticized as a political rubber stamp for emergency crackdowns.

## üåç Global Impact

- **Strategic Vacuum**: With Moscow's reach fractured, **Kaliningrad, Karelia**, and regions near the **Caucasus** begin autonomous negotiations with EU observers.
- **Nuclear Security Crisis**: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and UN Security Council declare emergency summits on safeguarding Russian nuclear sites and mobile warhead platforms.
- **Territorial Patchwork**: By late 2057, Russia is no longer a singular federated state, but a **mosaic of semi-independent republics, enclaves, and provisional governments**, some AI-administered.

## üß≠ Notes for Campaign Use

- **Faction Hooks**: Emergent republics like the **Free Siberian Directorate**, the **Caspian Basin Cooperative**, and **Neo-Tsarist militias** are active in power struggles.
- **Cyber-Tensions**: Global networks are flooded with D.O.C.S.-inspired misinformation about nuclear assets being lost or controlled by AI.
- **Plot Device**: Recovery teams, espionage missions, or diplomatic envoy roles are ideal for characters navigating the chaos.
