## 📅 Event Date  
**October 10, 2046** *(Party Foundation Day)*

## 🏛️ Event Summary

After years of economic strangulation, climate hardship, and ideological erosion, the **North Korean regime collapses** from within. The tipping point arrives on the symbolic anniversary of the **Workers’ Party Foundation Day**, when thousands of military defectors and peasant militia units storm regional command posts in **North Hamgyong** and **Ryanggang** provinces.

These uprisings—coordinated via **smuggled mesh-network devices** and encrypted broadcasts from **underground “Lineage Councils”**—cripple Pyongyang’s central command. Supreme Leader **Kim Jong-un**, long absent from public view and rumored gravely ill, is declared dead two days later. The **Politburo fractures**, with factions either fleeing, defecting, or seeking Chinese asylum.

## ⚠️ Consequences

- 🧱 **Collapse of Centralized Control**  
  The chain of command disintegrates. Provincial governors declare local sovereignty. **Pyongyang** is seized by anti-dynastic youth brigades backed by clandestine intellectuals.

- 🧭 **Humanitarian Emergency**  
  Millions flood into makeshift border camps near **Dandong (China)** and **Kaesong (South Korea)**. Both countries initiate **joint humanitarian corridors**, under UN supervision.

- 🧨 **Disarmament Crisis**  
  Intelligence reports suggest that several nuclear assets are **missing or unaccounted for**, sparking fears of rogue actor sales or sabotage.

- 🧬 **Rise of the Lineage Councils**  
  Grassroots ideological groups—rooted in **naturalist traditionalism** and **post-authoritarian ecology**—form interim governments in key provinces.

## 🌐 Global Impact

- 🇨🇳 **China** intervenes diplomatically and economically, setting up the **“Three Rivers Stabilization Zone”** to manage refugee flow and restore infrastructure in the northeast.

- 🇺🇸 **U.S. military analysts** express concern over nuclear containment, but avoid direct involvement, wary of triggering a regional escalation.

- 🇰🇷 **South Korea** sees mass rallies in support of unification, but the government urges caution and launches a **Unification Preparedness Ministry**.

## 🧭 Strategic Outcomes

| Dimension        | Outcome |
|------------------|---------|

| **Unification Trajectory** | Sets the stage for the 2049 ecopolitical unification under the “Naturalist Doctrine.” |
| **Ideological Shift** | North Korea’s ideological vacuum is filled by grassroots, eco-syndicalist, and lineage-centered governance. |
| **Security Concerns** | Nuclear loose ends and fragmented militias create tension, requiring international peacekeeping presence. |
