## 🌍 **Post-Breakup Russian Political Structure (2056–2075)**

Following the **"Breakup of the Russian Federation"** beginning in 2056 (see: Chechnya Secession Referendum, Novosibirsk Autonomy Treaty), Russia adopted a **quasi-dualist model**:

|Tier|Region/Zone Type|Governance Status|
|---|---|---|
|**Tier 1**|Capital & Sub-Capital Urban Cores (e.g., Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Vladivostok)|Direct presidential administration with AI-governed urban systems and full biometric-civic integration.|
|**Tier 2**|Rural Buffer Zones & Eco-Autonomous Districts (e.g., Altai, Karelia, parts of Buryatia)|Governed via **Eco-Social Autonomy Compacts (ESACs)**; communes manage land, energy, and climate roles under federal oversight.|

## 🧠 Integration of the Centralized/Decentralized Duality

### 📌 Russia’s Adaptation (2025–2075)

- While global systems **shifted toward dual urban–commune models**, Russia maintained its historic pattern:
    
    - **Rigid central planning in urban AI-governed regions.**
        
    - **Heavily regulated decentralization** in “zones of tolerated self-management,” primarily in climate-affected or low-population oblasts.
        
- Decentralized Eco-Communist Communes (DECCs) were **legally tolerated**, but:
    
    - **Heavily monitored via satellite and neural-mesh sensors.**
        
    - Required to submit to **annual soil, emissions, and ideological neutrality audits.**
