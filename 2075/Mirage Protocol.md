📆 **2034-06-03** — **“The Mirage Protocol”: Global Treaty on Synthetic Media**

### **Event:**

In the volatile aftermath of “Black August,” a **hyperreal AI-generated video falsely implicates Argentina in the assassination** of Brazil’s president during a major regional summit. The video spreads globally within 6 hours, destabilizing South American diplomacy and nearly triggering military retaliation.

### **Consequences:**

- The UN calls an **emergency summit** on synthetic media credibility and the emerging threat of _AI-forged evidence in national security_.
    
- 73 countries sign the **“Mirage Protocol”**, requiring:
    
    - **Mandatory watermarking and blockchain-based verification** of all publicly distributed AI-generated content.
        
    - **Real-time validation layers** in all major platform algorithms.
        
- Tech platforms are sanctioned for non-compliance; open-source AI projects are heavily scrutinized.
    

### **Pushback:**

- Iran, North Korea, and Russia refuse to sign, forming the **“Info Sovereignty Coalition”**, promoting each nation’s right to define and manufacture its own “truth.”
    
- China signs conditionally but **quietly begins internal restructuring of its AI propaganda and censorship infrastructure**, influenced by the D.O.C.S. panic.
