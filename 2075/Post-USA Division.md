## üåç Global Impact Summary

|Domain|Effect|
|---|---|
|**Trade & Shipping**|CSA maintains access via Gulf + San Diego; UDP dominates Pacific and Atlantic commerce.|
|**Digital Ecosystems**|CSA operates isolated ‚ÄúMAGA-Net‚Äù; UDP integrates with global open-stack networks.|
|**Military**|Cold tension remains; minor skirmishes occur, but total war is deterred by economic interdependence.|
