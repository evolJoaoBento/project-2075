**Event:** On September 29, 2070, the [[African Union]] (AU) announces the successful implementation of its long-envisioned integration milestones: the launch of a common defense pact, the adoption of a unified currency named the “[[Afriqa]],” and the inauguration of the [[African Orbital Gateway]], a continent-wide space launch system. This achievement marks the culmination of decades of strategic planning under Agenda 2063, positioning Africa as a formidable global power.

**Consequences:**

* The “[[Afriqa]]” currency, managed by the newly established [[African Central Bank]], facilitates seamless intra-continental trade and attracts significant foreign investment, reducing reliance on external financial systems.

* The [[African Continental Defense Force]] (ACDF) is deployed to stabilize conflict zones and protect strategic interests, enhancing regional security and deterring external interference.

* The [[African Orbital Gateway]] enables independent satellite launches and deep-space missions, fostering advancements in telecommunications, earth observation, and scientific research.

* [[Nigeria]] and [[Kenya]] emerge as co-hegemons, leading in economic innovation and technological development, while [[South Africa]] and [[Egypt]] serve as pivotal diplomatic and military hubs.

* Global powers, including [[China]], the [[United States of America|United States]], and the [[European Union]], seek strategic partnerships with the AU, leading to renegotiated trade agreements and collaborative initiatives in infrastructure and technology.{index=21}

**Global Impact:** The [[African Union]]'s transformation into a superpower bloc redefines global geopolitics, shifting the balance of power and introducing a new era of multipolarity. Africa's unified stance amplifies its voice in international forums, influences global policy-making, and fosters a more equitable global order. The AU's success serves as a model for regional integration and collective advancement. [[Hex_0_0 1]]
