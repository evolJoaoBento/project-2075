### **Event:**

Following years of **foreign AI intrusions, DOCS propaganda, and escalating disinformation**, China enacts **Firewall 2.0**, deploying quantum-encrypted AI governance over all digital networks. The firewall cuts all **non-Chinese platforms and services** from access within the mainland and its digital satellite states.

### **Consequences:**

- China establishes the **“SinoNet”**, an intranet alternative spanning its allies across Central Asia, Africa, and parts of the Middle East.
    
- Western democracies respond with the **“Open Net Compact”**, a federation of verified, cryptographically authenticated open-source services.
    
- **Non-aligned countries** are pressured to choose between East or West digital blocs for access to platforms, trade, and cyber assistance.
    


### **Impact:**

- Global internet **fractures into parallel sovereign internets**.
    
- AI misinformation grows more advanced and **bloc-specific**, fueling segmented information ecosystems.
    
- Underground movements thrive through **AI-personalized VPNs**, creating an era of **digital smuggling** and **underground synthetic truth economies**.
