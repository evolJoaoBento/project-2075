You've asked me to rewrite the previously provided custom subclasses, ensuring that each one includes a **foundational, a specialization, and a mastery feature**, as defined in Daggerheart.

In Daggerheart, subclasses are key to defining a character's archetype, with features that evolve through play.

- **Foundation Feature**: This is the **unique starting feature** that establishes the core identity and initial strengths of the subclass.
- **Specialization Feature**: This is a **more advanced feature** gained at higher levels, expanding upon the foundation or introducing new, potent capabilities.
- **Mastery Feature**: This is the subclass's **most powerful feature**, typically gained at higher levels, representing the culmination of the subclass's core identity and unlocking extraordinary abilities.
- Additionally, if the subclass is for a spellcaster, it will specify a **Spellcast Trait**, which is the character trait used for all Spellcast Rolls.

These features are typically gained via individual cards chosen as benefits when leveling up. I will integrate the thematic elements of _Cyberpunk RED_ roles into these Daggerheart structures.

Please note that these subclasses and their features are **not** found in your provided _Daggerheart_ sources. They are a creative interpretation based on your query, blending the concepts from _Cyberpunk RED_ with _Daggerheart_'s character creation and class structure. As such, these would be custom additions to the game and would require independent verification for balance and integration into an actual campaign.

---

Here are the rewritten custom Daggerheart subclasses, each with a foundational, specialization, and mastery feature:

### 1. Rockerboy (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Rockerboys)

### 2. Solo (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Solos)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Warrior
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Solos are "elite fighting machines" who act as assassins, bodyguards, and soldiers-for-hire, relying on combat drugs and cybertech. This is a natural extension of the Warrior's focus on combat and striking down adversaries.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Chrome Sentinel Warrior**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Strength (Warriors don't typically have a Spellcast Trait unless multiclassing. If this subclass allows for magical or cyber-enhanced attacks as a core part of its identity, a Spellcast Trait might apply.)
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Combat Synapses** [inspired by Solo's boosted reflexes and combat drugs, 409, 481]: When you make an attack roll with an equipped weapon, you can mark 1 Stress to re-roll up to two of your damage dice after seeing the initial results.
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **Augmented Resilience** [inspired by Solos using cyberlimbs for armor, 409, 481]: When you would mark an Armor Slot from incoming physical damage, you can reduce the severity of the damage by one threshold by marking 1 Stress. You can do this once per round.
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Overclocked Combatant** [inspired by Solo's amplified reflexes and speed from cyberware, 409, 481]: Once per long rest, you can enter an overclocked state for 3 rounds. While in this state, you gain a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls, and your movement range increases by one step (e.g., Close becomes Very Close for movement). At the end of the effect, mark 2 Stress from the strain. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

### 3. Netrunner (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Netrunners)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Wizard
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Netrunners are "brain-burning computer hackers" who "slip into the 'hardest' mainframe systems with ease: stealing, trading, and selling their deepest secrets". This fits the Wizard's mastery of trained magic and keen understanding of the world, re-flavored as technological expertise.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Data Weaver Wizard**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Knowledge
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Digital Ghosting** [inspired by Netrunner's ability to slip into systems anonymously, 411]: When you make a Knowledge roll to gather information or interact with complex devices, you can mark 1 Stress to apply your Experience modifier twice to the roll.
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **System Overload** [inspired by Black ICE effects, 558]: When you succeed on a Spellcast Roll, you can mark 1 Stress to cause a targeted electronic device (or an adversary with integrated cyberware) within Close range to malfunction. This gives the device's user or the adversary disadvantage on their next action roll involving that device or cyberware. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Architect's Command** [inspired by "brain-burning" hackers, creating viruses that persist, 410, 556]: Once per long rest, you can make a Spellcast Roll (Difficulty 18) targeting a connected electronic system or an adversary with integrated cyberware within Very Far range. On a success, you can choose one of the following: either force the system to shut down for 1d4 rounds (or equivalent effect on adversary like Stunned), OR you gain full control of one of the target's basic sensory inputs (sight, hearing) for the remainder of the scene, allowing you to see/hear through them. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

### 4. Tech (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Techs)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Guardian
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Techs are "renegade mechanics and supertech inventors" who build, fix, and modify items. While Guardians usually protect, this subclass embodies the Guardian's role through creating defensive structures or supporting allies with technological aids.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Gearsmith Guardian**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Instinct (Guardians don't typically have a Spellcast Trait unless multiclassing. If this subclass allows for magical or cyber-enhanced abilities as a core part of its identity, a Spellcast Trait might apply.)
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Improvised Defense** [inspired by Techs making new items and fixing things, 414]: As an action, you can mark 1 Stress to create a temporary piece of cover (e.g., a barricade of scrap, a deployable shield generator) at Very Close range. This cover has 10 temporary HP and provides 2 bonus Armor Score to anyone behind it. It lasts until the end of the scene or it is destroyed. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **Automated Support** [inspired by Techs' robot and drone mechanic abilities, 369]: Once per long rest, you can deploy a small "utility drone" (or re-flavor as a magical construct like a Golem, drawing on the idea of creating constructs in Daggerheart). This drone can, as an action, either apply a +1 bonus to an ally's attack roll or grant them 1 temporary HP. The drone lasts for 3 rounds. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Field Fortification** [inspired by Techs inventing new items, upgrading things permanently, 414, 527]: As a downtime move (or once per long rest in combat by marking 2 Stress), you can construct a powerful, permanent defensive structure or vehicle modification. Choose one of the following: a barricade that provides Resistance to physical damage to all allies behind it, OR upgrade an ally's weapon to gain +1 damage for the rest of the session, OR create an automated turret with 15 HP that deals 2d6 physical damage to a target within Far range each round, lasting until destroyed or the end of the scene. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

### 5. Medtech (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Medtechs)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Druid
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Medtechs are "artists" of the human body who "keep people alive who should be dead" and "splice cyberware back together". This mirrors the Druid's healing abilities and connection to renewal, re-imagined through a technological lens rather than a natural one.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Bio-Engineer Druid**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Instinct
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Vital Systems Scan** [inspired by Medtechs diagnosing illness and injury, 415, 530]: When you interact with an injured or ailing creature, you can make an Instinct roll (Difficulty determined by GM based on severity) to gain insight into their condition and potential remedies. On a success, you can clear 1 Stress from them or give them advantage on their next recovery roll.
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **Emergency Stimpack** [inspired by Medtechs' pharmaceutical skills, 415, 532]: Once per rest, when an ally marks 2 or more Hit Points from a single attack, you can mark 1 Stress to immediately clear 1 Hit Point from them. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Life Support Override** [inspired by Medtechs "keeping people alive who should be dead" and treating critical injuries, 415, 530, 577]: Once per long rest, when an ally within Close range is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you can mark 3 Stress to immediately stabilize them at 1 Hit Point, and they ignore all negative conditions (including Critical Injuries) for 1 round. This ability also clears all marked Hit Points on yourself up to your maximum. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

### 6. Media (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Medias)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Bard
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Medias are "city-wide figures" who "dig down for the dirt and slime" to expose corrupt officials and Corporate actions. While the Bard's Wordsmith subclass focuses on captivating crowds, the Media-inspired subclass uses performance and rhetoric to uncover and spread truth, aligning with the Bard's core abilities.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Truth Speaker Bard**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Presence
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Public Scrutiny** [inspired by Media's influence on public perception, 416]: When you publicly expose a secret or piece of information, you can mark 1 Stress to gain advantage on a Presence roll to persuade a crowd or intimidate a target. If successful, you also gain 1 Hope as the public reacts strongly to your revelation.
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **Spotlight Shift** [inspired by Medias drawing attention, 416]: Once per rest, you can mark 1 Stress to compel a non-player character (NPC) within Far range to make a Will Reaction Roll. On a failure, they become the focus of attention for other NPCs or adversaries, drawing them away from your allies for one round. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Echo Chamber** [inspired by Medias making headlines, influencing public opinion, 416, 623]: Once per long rest, you can make a Presence Spellcast Roll (Difficulty 16) targeting a prominent NPC or a group of NPCs within Far range. On a success, for the remainder of the scene, any social rolls made by you or your allies targeting these NPCs gain advantage, and any social rolls made by those NPCs against you or your allies have disadvantage, as your narrative becomes undeniably true for them. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

### 7. Exec (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Execs)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Rogue
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Execs are "wealthy, powerful" and manipulate others, often through "golden handcuffs" and covert operations. While the Rogue's Syndicate subclass already has a "web of contacts", an Exec-inspired subclass leans into more direct control, manipulation of resources, and subtle influence.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Corporate Operative Rogue**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Finesse
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Network of Influence** [inspired by Execs' power and connections, 417, 534]: When you attempt a social maneuver against an NPC with authority or wealth, you can spend 1 Hope to gain advantage on your Presence or Finesse roll. On a success, you can ask the GM one question about their motivations or hidden connections.
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **Resource Diversion** [inspired by Execs managing resources, 417, 534]: Once per long rest, when an ally rolls with Fear on an action roll, you can mark 1 Stress to change the Fear result to Hope and grant them a +1 bonus to the roll, representing a timely intervention or a hidden advantage you provided. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Executive Order** [inspired by Execs building teams, having covert roles, controlling resources, 417, 534, 598]: Once per long rest, when in a social setting or a scene involving a corporate or governmental power structure, you can make a Finesse Spellcast Roll (Difficulty 17). On a success, you can compel a single non-player character of significant influence (GM's discretion) to perform one action that aligns with their general motivations (even if it's against their immediate best interest) OR cause a minor system (e.g., security gate, light grid, automated vehicle) within Very Far range to malfunction or operate as you wish for one round. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

### 8. Lawman (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Lawmen)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Guardian
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Lawmen "work to keep people safe and make some kind of stand against chaos", often relying on backup. This aligns strongly with the Guardian's protective role and ability to take heavy blows.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Order Keeper Guardian**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Strength (Guardians don't typically have a Spellcast Trait unless multiclassing. If this subclass allows for magical or cyber-enhanced abilities as a core part of its identity, a Spellcast Trait might apply.)
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Unyielding Authority** [inspired by Lawmen's determination, 417]: When you would mark Stress from an adversary's Fear move, you can choose to mark 1 less Stress. Additionally, if you are within Melee range of that adversary, you can make an immediate Intimidate (Presence) roll against them.
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **Call for Backup** [inspired by Lawman's Backup Role Ability, 419, 542]: Once per long rest, you can spend 2 Hope to summon a "Law Enforcement Drone" that appears at Close range. This drone has 10 HP, 10 Evasion, and can make a single attack per round against a target within Very Close range, dealing 1d6 physical damage. It remains for 3 rounds or until destroyed. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Zone Enforcement** [inspired by Lawmen being able to bring overwhelming force, "Psycho Squad" hunting cyberpsychos, 418, 485, 544]: Once per long rest, you can spend 3 Hope to declare an area within Far range as a "Law Enforcement Zone" (up to a Close range radius). For the next 3 rounds, any adversary entering or starting their turn in this zone becomes Vulnerable, and you gain advantage on all attack rolls made against targets within this zone. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

### 9. Fixer (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Fixers)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Rogue
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Fixers are masters of the black market, adept at navigating social customs, and maintain "vast webs of contacts and clients". While the Rogue's Syndicate subclass also has contacts, the Fixer-inspired subclass focuses more on the _acquisition of goods_ and managing _transactions_ rather than just leveraging social connections.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Underground Broker Rogue**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Finesse
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Black Market Access** [inspired by Fixers getting things on the black market, 420, 647]: Once per session, you can spend 1 Hope and make a Finesse roll (Difficulty based on item rarity, GM's discretion) to acquire any non-magical item, even if it's illicit or rare. The item appears at your current location and you must pay its cost.
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **Quick Deals** [inspired by Fixers' trading abilities, 420]: During a short rest, you can choose to make a Trading (Presence or Instinct) roll. On a success, you gain 1d4 gold for each Hope die rolled. On a failure, you mark 1 Stress. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Supply Chain Control** [inspired by Fixers having "vast webs of contacts," sourcing desirable resources, and operating Night Markets, 420, 445, 614, 647]: Once per campaign (GM's discretion), you can initiate a "Supply Run" that allows you to acquire any one _rare_ non-magical item or resource (GM's discretion) within 1d4 days/sessions, at half its normal market price. Additionally, once per long rest, you can spend 1 Hope to reduce the Hope cost of using any other character's Experience by 1 for the rest of the scene. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

### 10. Nomad (Inspired by _Cyberpunk RED_'s Nomads)

- **Daggerheart Class:** Ranger
- **Thematic Fit:** _Cyberpunk RED_ Nomads "control the highways and sea lanes" and are experts in construction and transportation, often traveling in "Nomad packs". This aligns with the Ranger's connection to traversal and companionship, extending beyond just wild animals to include engineered vehicles or mobile strongholds.
- **New Subclass Name:** **Wasteland Wanderer Ranger**
    - **Spellcast Trait:** Instinct
    - **Foundation Feature:** **Road-Hardened** [inspired by Nomads traversing the wastes, 420]: You and your closest allies (up to 3) within Close range gain a +1 bonus to Evasion while in open or unrefined terrain. Additionally, you have advantage on rolls to navigate difficult non-urban terrain.
    - **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: **Mobile Base** [inspired by Nomad packs and their caravans, 420, 698]: Once per long rest, you can designate a vehicle or large object you are traveling with as a "Mobile Base." While within or adjacent to this Mobile Base, you and your allies gain 1 additional Hope whenever you take a short rest. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._
    - **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: **Convoy Commander** [inspired by Nomads controlling highways, being experts in transportation and construction, Nomad packs, 420, 565, 698]: Once per long rest, you can call upon your "Nomad Pack" (or re-flavor as summoned mounts/constructs). A powerful vehicle (e.g., a heavily armored "Kombi" or similar construct) with 30 HP and a basic attack (2d6 physical damage) appears within Far range and can act on your initiative. While it is active, you and your allies within Close range of it gain resistance to physical damage and advantage on rolls to avoid being Restrained. The vehicle lasts until destroyed or the end of the scene. _This information is not from the Daggerheart sources and you may want to independently verify that this is a balanced effect for the game._

---

These subclasses aim to capture the essence of _Cyberpunk RED_ roles within the _Daggerheart_ framework, offering new mechanical options and thematic depth while remaining distinct from the existing _Daggerheart_ subclasses. They represent a blend of technological inspiration with the magical world of Daggerheart, much like a skilled hacker might weave new code into an ancient, powerful system to achieve unforeseen results.
