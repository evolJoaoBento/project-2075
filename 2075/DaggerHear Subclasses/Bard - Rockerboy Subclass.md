## **Thematic Fit:**
Rockerboys are "rock-and-roll rebels who use performance, art, and rhetoric to fight authority".
## **Spellcast Trait:** 
Presence
### **Foundation Feature:** 
#### **Cultivate Following**: 
Once per session, you can make a **Presence roll (Difficulty 10) to influence a non-adversary NPC or group to become fans**, you can **roll your rally dice** to gain **Fan Tokens**. You can have a **maximum number of Fan tokens equal to your Proficiency**. You can **spend Fan Tokens to make an equal amount of fans within Far range take non-combat actions** *(GM's discretion)*. These tokens clear at the end of a long rest. 
### **Specialization Feature (Tier 2/Levels 2-4)**: 
#### **Rallying Cry** : 
Once per rest, you can **spend a Hope and any number of Fan Tokens** to make an equal amount of Fans within **Far range** take **_non-sacrificial combat action_** *(GM's discretion)*, such as actively interfering with an authority figure's non-combat actions. This expands the Rockerboy's influence to direct their followers in beneficial ways.
### **Mastery Feature (Tier 3-4/Levels 5-10)**: 
#### **Mobilize the Masses**
Once per long rest, you can **spend 3 Hope and any number of Fan Tokens** and choose a location within **Very Far range**. A group of non-adversary NPCs ("**The Mob**") appears in that location, equal to twice the spent Fan Tokens. For the next 3 rounds, "The Mob" acts on your initiative and can perform **one collective action per round** at your direction and each fan has 1 HP and an Evasion of 8. If **"The Mob" is hit they disperse and one member dies**, they can be individually hit when dispersed but **regather at the start of your turn**.
