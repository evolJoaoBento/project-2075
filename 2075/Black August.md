**“Black August”: Coordinated AI-Driven Cyber Offensive**

### **Event:**

An anonymous, decentralized group calling itself [[D.O.C.S.]] launches **massive synchronized cyberattacks** targeting global financial systems, leveraging adaptive AI malware. The operation paralyzes stock exchanges in New York, Shanghai, São Paulo, and Frankfurt. Banks and crypto wallets are compromised with deepfake customer identity overrides.

### **Consequences:**

- Major stock exchanges are **shut down for days**.
    
- **Digital currencies collapse**, and some nations **temporarily reinstate cash-based emergency economies**.
    
- The G20 rushes to **formalize cyber defense treaties**, including _shared AI threat detection frameworks_ and _sovereign node backups_.
    

### **Geopolitical Fallout:**

- The attack is eventually claimed by **D.O.C.S.**, a post-labor cyber-terrorist organization promoting a “Post-Laboral Future” and the **deconstruction of global capital via AI disruption**.
    
- The attacks expose **deep weaknesses in global AI authentication and cybersecurity coordination**.
    
- China accuses the West of engineering the attack to justify further surveillance; the West accuses China of covert support for D.O.C.S. cells.
