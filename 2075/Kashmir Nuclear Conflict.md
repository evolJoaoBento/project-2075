## ‚ò¢Ô∏è **"Kashmir Nuclear Flashpoint Amid Climate Crisis"**

---

### **Event Summary**

In the wake of the devastating 2040 South Asian heatwave, which led to over 1.5 million fatalities and massive displacement, regional tensions between India and Pakistan reach a boiling point. On June 15, 2041, a coordinated terrorist attack in Mumbai results in significant casualties. India attributes the attack to Pakistan-based militant groups, leading to a series of retaliatory military actions. A miscalculated strike inadvertently damages a Pakistani nuclear command facility, prompting Pakistan to respond with a tactical nuclear strike in the Thar Desert region of Rajasthan.([news.com.au](https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/india-and-pakistan-nations-on-brink-of-nuclear-war/news-story/2f6d318483fdad71eebf466349123137?utm_source=chatgpt.com "'Nuclear war' imminent, experts warn"))
